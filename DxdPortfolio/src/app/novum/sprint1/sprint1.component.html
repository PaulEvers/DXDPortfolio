      <h2 class="title is-2">Introduction</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>During this semester each of us has a group project. There were 4 companies we could choose from to have our
        group assignment for. I chose for the Novum project. I got paired with Jessica, Pei-Yu, Wendy, Diana, and
        Diederik. Novum is a subsidiary of the Social Security Bank (SVB in dutch). They specialize in innovation and
        unconventional solutions for government departments that might need one.
        For us, they came up with an assignment to make it easier for people to give power of attorney to others. When
        someone has power of attorney of someone, they can perfrom actions in their name. For example: open a bank
        account, receive government funds, manage their pension, etc. As of now, there is no easy-to-use solution to
        give this power.
      </p>
      <p>The first sprint focusses on empathizing. This means we want to define our target audience and connect with
        them; listen to their needs and wants, and the problems they are facing.</p>


      <!-- Debriefing -->
      <h2 class="title is-2">Debriefing & Defining</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>After we introduced ourselves to eachother and to our product owner Matthijs, it was time to get to work. Our
        first step was to debrief the loads of initial information we have gotten from Matthijs. It became clear that
        the most important target audience would be elderly people, who are digitally literate, as they might have the
        most problems with arranging power of attorney. From this debriefing we came up with the following design
        challenge:</p>
      <h3 class="is-3 quote">
        <i>
          "Design a digital authorization system to enable elderly people who will no longer be competent in the future
          to digitally authorize others to securely arrange and manage their digital administration."
        </i>
      </h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 1em;">To see if there were perhaps already solutions to this problem. We made a competitor
        analysis. This analysis shows potential solutions that have to do with giving away power. For example
        <i>Facebook permissions</i>. But we also looked at how power of attorney is arranged in other countries such as
        Great Brittain. The full competitor analysis can be found <a
          href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dxdportfolio.appspot.com/o/novum%2FSprint%201%2FCompetition%20Analysis.pdf?alt=media&token=540cd3f4-b4ca-42e8-9c8d-a793dfe3d381"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
      <p>In this research we also found out the types of power of attorney in the Netherlands:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Full power of attorney (Algehele volmacht)</b> - A donor can appoint a close person as their attorney.
          When giving full power, the attorney can make important financial decisions for the donor. Such as, selling
          estate, gifting money, and taking loans for the donor.
        </li>
        <li><b>Special power of attorney (Bijzondere volmacht)</b> - This gives the attorney only a specific role they
          may fulfill.</li>
        <li><b>Notarized power of attorney (Notariële volmacht)</b> - This is done together with a notary. The notary
          checks the mental state of the donor, when in doubt, an independant doctor might be requested to judge the
          donor’s mental state. If the mental state of the donor is not in order, a court needs to decide if the power
          of attorney can be given. Notarized power of attorney is the most common one.</li>
        <li><b>Private power of attorney (Onderhandse volmacht)</b> - A donor can give power of attorney without a
          notary. Not having a notary present, prevents the attorney from getting full power over certain actions such
          as getting a mortgage.</li>
        <li><b>Bank power of attorney (Bankvolmacht)</b> - This gives an attorney permission to manage a donor’s bank
          account. This is organized directly with the bank and no government interference. Both the permission of the
          donor and attorney is needed. The bank will not check if the bank account of the donor is being misused.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Notarized power is the most common one, the only one that is protected by law and goes
        beyond banking rights. This information might prove useful in the future to make sure our solution is protected
        by law as well.</p>

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <h2 class="title is-2">Empathizing</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>To make sure we know the needs of our target audience, we need to empathize with them. To achieve this we have
        come up with multiple approaches:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1-on-1 interviews</li>
        <li>Street interviews</li>
        <li>Surveys</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I worked on the 1-on-1 interviews and the street interviews. However, in this sprint I only got to work on the
        1-on-1 interviews.</p>

      <!-- Empathizing -->
      <h2 class="title is-2">1-on-1 interviews</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>For the 1-on-1 interviews we first made a plan on what we wanted to ask, and how we wanted to condutct the
        interview. The main points we wanted answers on were their experience with digital tools, and their knowledge
        about power of attorney in general. The preparation for these interviews can be found <a
          href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dxdportfolio.appspot.com/o/novum%2FSprint%201%2FTarget%20Group%20Interview%20prep.pdf?alt=media&token=544027ab-86cf-468d-97f9-b37483299032"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The first interview I conducted, turned out to be an extreme user. The interviewee runs his own tax
        consultancy business and therefore had a lot of experience with customers who would sometimes have gotten or
        given power of attorney. Besides that, he was also very knowledgeable about the topic of power of attorney
        itself. The full 45 minute interview is in dutch and can be listened to here:</p>

        <audio style="width: 100%;" controls>

        </audio>
      </mat-card>
      <p>After the interview concluded, me and another teammate analysed the audio for insights. These were some of the
        most important insights we gathered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal connection and trust with an attorney is important to people.</li>
        <li>Many elderly in his attorney office still prefer physical copies instead of PDF mails.</li>
        <li>People don’t like to interact with government institutions.</li>
        <li>Interviewee finds that the current state of power of attorney is safer but more cumbersome for both him and
          his clients.
          But he thinks safety can not be compromised.</li>
        <li>People like to give away cumbersome tasks even though they might not be hard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After this expert interview we also interviewed some 'regular' elderly to get a clear understanding of the
        average perception of digital tools and power of attorney. Their most important insights go as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most know what power of attorney is.</li>
        <li>No one has arranged for power of attorney.</li>
        <li>Most would give their DigiD password to their close relatives (partner, children) to do their business.</li>
        <li>Most use mobile banking.</li>
        <li>Some gestures on phones are confusing to elderly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The full lists on insights, including those of the extreme user, can be found <a
          href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dxdportfolio.appspot.com/o/novum%2FSprint%201%2FInsights%20elderly%20sprint%201.pdf?alt=media&token=509362e3-1d22-4d8b-bc21-bcef065b5acb"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

      <p>From these insights we created several persona's. These persona's can later be used to make a customer journey
        to help us find painpoints of the target group. Here is an example of one of the persona's:</p>

      <!-- Reflection -->
      <h2 class="title is-2">Reflection</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I think our first sprint went very well. I feel like we have a nice team with motivated members. At the
        beginning of the sprint we decided to follow the Scrum methodology. This means we will have daily stand-ups and
        a retrospective after each sprint. Diederik served as our Scrum master. This means he leads the daily-standups.
      </p>
      <p>I think the daily standups were helpful to see what everyone was doing, but I feel like we are having too many.
        Considering that we also have other subjects to work on, and can't work everyday on the Novum project, it would
        often happen that nobody really had to say anything useful during the standups. </p>
      <p>Concerning the actual work in this sprint, I feel like I have learned a lot of things. I have never used a
        design-thinking method before so the empathizing and doing research felt very refreshing. I also noticed that I
        got better in conducting the interviews and asking more targeted question. All-in-all I think we are on a great
        track.</p>
      <p>Below you can see the presentation we held at the end of the sprint to Novum and our teachers:</p>
